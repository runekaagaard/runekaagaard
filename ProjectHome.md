## Minisloc ##
I wanted to update my ancient Mambo website to a new version. I just started creating a new drupal (which i know and love from work) installation when I suddenly got bored. Mysql database, 1000's of files, all these rules, so i decided to see how simple i could make a mini framework tailored to my specific needs.

Uses just simple OOP and procedural PHP. Using a lot of YAML and Markdown.

Depends on APC.
